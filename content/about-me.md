hi! I'm "sola" - a developer / creative based in Manchester, UK. 

### professional 

My professional experience lies in web development and user experience design, with 4 years spent across various teams in the BBC - working on projects including CBeebies, CBBC, Newsround, Own It, News and Sport. 

I am familiar with using CI/CD pipelines, version control and project management tooling. I regularly performed code reviews on top of picking up experience in project management, data analysis, user research and A/B testing. 

My academic background is topped by a BSc in Software Engineering. In my spare time, I have picked up experience in game development, game design, software/app development, graphic design, motion design, digital art, 3D modelling and music production. 

### community management

I've spent around 6 years managing online communities. 

From connecting with people of all ages, cultures and backgrounds, to driving community engagement and change and all of the more personal aspects of community management, to say it has been a lifechanging experience would sell it short. 

I have learned to navigate the unique complexities that arise with the diversity and freedom these communities offer. Each day different from the last, the role requires an eye for detail, good memory and plenty of patience. Teamwork is essential, requiring high levels of trust, clear communications and a strong personal sense of responsibility.         

### personal

Pursuing knowledge is where I find the most joy in life. I continue to learn a wide range of fields with a particular interest in astronomy, biology, environmental sciences, geology, geography, history and more.

Feedback, especially critiscism, drives me.

You'll often catch me working on side projects or prototypes to push myself and test new ideas. 

Other interests include photography, walking/hiking, football and guitar.
